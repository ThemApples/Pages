          <h2>Trying Something New</h2>
          <h5>October 2019</h5>
          <p>I am working, so I have very little time to access my laptop and when I do the windows operating system keeps giving an update message. When I do update my operating system, it slows the laptop down and makes it harder for me to learn to program and even daily tasks such as checking email and news.
          I ended up taking up online advise. The advice was changing to a Linux based operating system.
          I ended up installing elementary os on my laptop. It was my first time using a Linux based operating system, after install the operating system my problems were gone.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h2>Update</h2>
          <h5>November 2019</h5>
          <p>One month of using Elementary OS and I'm enjoying it. However, I'm encountering minor problems just small things like wifi turning on by itself, date and time sometimes changing.
             At least I can do my daily tasks with no problem. The next step is to find good programming idle to work on with Linux.</p>
        </div>

          <h2>Christmas</h2>
          <h5>December 2019</h5>
          <p>I won't have time to do any upskilling because the Christmas shifts are here. The only thing I'm looking forward to is Christmas holidays. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h2>New Year</h2>
          <h5>January 2020</h5>
          <p>The Christmas season is finally over. Everything will slowly go back to normal. I can get back into the routine of upskilling. I have some programming in mind. I can get some android studio started. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h2>Update</h2>
          <h5>February 2020</h5>
          <p>February is finally here, Covid-19 situation hasn't changed. Another month has gone by with no upskilling. The hugest improvement I have made is to become more familiar with the Linux operating system. I have yet to attempt programming on a Linux based operating system as I have previously mentioned my first programming idle will probably be Android studio. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h2>Covid -19</h2>
          <h5>February 2020 Update</h5>
          <p>The announcement of the first patient with Covid-19 was in New Zealand. With this, upskilling will be on hold once again.
          My first experience with something this extreme, the last biological infection I can remember is swine-flu and didn't get out of hand.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h2>Update</h2>
          <h5>March 2020</h5>
          <p>Covid-19 is still here, It has been challenging to get through this month. I would be called randomly to cover someones shift because of these changes I have had many sleepless nights. </p>

          <h2>Small Improvements</h2>
          <h5>April 2020</h5>
          <p>I have finally installed programming Idle, it was Android studio. In windows, I had a lot of trouble trying to get the virtual android working. In Linux, it was just as difficult I came across several errors. I have to leave it for another day because I have chores and work.
          We were moving house too so, at night we would be moving some items to the new house before the big move.<p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h2>Changes</h2>
          <h5>May 2020</h5>
          <p>I've been encountering minor errors throughout the use of my Linux operating system such programs crashing and getting an error message saying something is not responding. Since my system is crashing and my Idle also stopped working, I might as well install a new operating system together. I decided to use Linux mint since it doesn't demand too much hardware. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h2>Slowly Improving</h2>
          <h5>June 2020</h5>
           <p>Recently, I've been concerned about security . Hearing about the news and being under lockdown, security is becoming more vital due to more constant scams. As a result, I have checked around on the internet and asked for security advice.  Most popular security advice is changing email, change passwords on a regular basis and use an offline password manager if you can't remember your passwords.</p>

          <h2>UpSkilling</h2>
          <h5>July 2020</h5>
          <p>
          Recently, I've been taking lessons online to improve my programming skills. However, the skills I have been learning are the basics because the fundamentals are more important to have. Having the fundamentals will allow me to have a clear understanding of any problems I encounter.  Skills I'm looking into at the moment are Android development, HTML, Kotlin and Python.</p>

          <h2>Revising</h2>
          <h5>August 2020</h5>
          <p>
           I went back to my notes in University and looked into prototyping. I went online to find a tool that could help but a lot of them needed some art experience.
           I came across a program called Figma. It was easy to use and the program allowed me to show my image of a complete product in real-time.
           I also came across journalling in my university notes, I didn't understand it at the time but now I know its a positive way for me to keep me on track in development and not repeat my mistakes. </p>

          <h2>Developing</h2>
          <h5>September 2020</h5>
          <p>
           Recently, It's time for me to use the skills I have learnt to develop some projects. There several projects I have in mind such as a Qr scanner, a website and a timeline generator.
           <br></br>
           The challenge so far is using Kotlin, it's easy to use since I have used java in the past.
           <br></br>
           The most trouble isn't using the language but using the IDLE to develop a project with it. </p>

          <h2>Long Weekend</h2>
          <h5>October 2020</h5>
          <p>
           Long Weekend is coming up, a lot of people have plans to go out. It is terrifying to think about the increasing amount of people entering the country and with the uncertainty of who has or maybe carrying covid-19.
           <br></br>
 		      We have told to use the countries tracer app more often in case people start to catch the virus.
           <br></br>
 		      I don't have plans of going out. I'm going to enjoy myself at home with my family. </p>

          <h2>Update Blog</h2>
          <h5>19 October 2020</h5>
          <p>
            I decided to update my website with a profile picture. Something that doesn't show who I directly am but the shows my figure.
            <br></br>
            I followed a few tutorials on youtube to get the picture like this. This experience was beneficial to get a better understanding of the software Inkscape.
            <br></br>
            1.  The step was easy to understand.</br>
            2.  Take a photo of yourself</br>
            3.  Put the photo on your laptop/computer</br>
            4.  Open the photo on any image editing software</br>
            5.  Draw outlines of the features in your photo</br>
            6.  fill in the outlined shapes with the colour of your choice<br></br>

            The picture didn't come out as I imaged. My mistake was leaving spaces between each shape.

          <h2>Update Blog</h2>
          <h5>November 2020</h5>
          <p>
            Yesterday, I decided to change my operating system because something was causing my laptop to heat up quickly and to slow down my processors. I confirmed this by using the htop command on my terminal my processors were pushing hard even though nothing was active. I'm assuming it was the hardware requirements. As a result, I searched online for an operating system that can work on old hardware to test whether my theory was right.
            <br></br>
            I search for an Operating systems distribution for an hour. There were a lot of them that require faster hardware. That was disappointing wasting an hour and not finding something that will run well on a laptop. I remember a few YouTubers saying an XFCE based operating system would work well with older hardware.
            <br></br>
            I found one that was interesting to me, called Xubuntu. I tested the live session to see whether it was the same as the Youtuber said. I also had to check whether screen tearing was present for functionality purposes.
           <br></br>
            I installed the operating system onto my laptop. The installation didn't take very long to finish. Everything was functioning properly until I attempted to modernize the appearance of the operating system. I log out of my laptop to see if the log out functionality was working. It didn't work on the operating system it would loop presenting a blank screen and my login page. whenever the login pape showed up I tried to log in but the screen would change to the blank immediately.
            <br></br>
            I was stuck on this problem for around 2 hours. I searched online to find a solution but I could not find one. I ended up getting an older build and installing that. It worked. Everything was functional.
